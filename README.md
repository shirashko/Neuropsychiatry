## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing personality traits data and discovering patterns through clustering analysis. It involves preprocessing the data, performing K-means clustering, visualizing the clusters, and examining the correlation between different personality factors.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akdagmelih/five-personality-clusters-k-means). The original dataset contains personality traits survey data. The survey responses are categorized into different traits such as extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, methodicalness, ambition, and openness.

## Data Preprocessing

Before the analysis, the raw data is preprocessed, which includes:
- Dropping irrelevant columns
- Handling missing values
- Renaming columns
- Scaling the data using MinMaxScaler

## Clustering

The main analysis involves K-means clustering, where the scaled data is clustered into distinct groups based on the similarity of personality traits.

## Visualization

The project includes visualizations of:
- Histograms depicting the distribution of answers for each question within trait groups
- Bar plots and line plots to display the means of personality factors for each cluster
- 2D scatter plot using PCA to visualize the clusters

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrices are computed to examine relationships between different personality factors. Heatmaps are used to visualize the correlation values.
